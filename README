Modified so you can compile on Ubuntu 18.04 w/ Emscripten 1.38.27 - No other improvements made (but welcome any)

Emscripten-ScummVM README
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fork of the upstream ScummVM repository at https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm 
focused on building ScummVM as HTML5.

Build Instructions
------------------

See docker/Dockerfile.

After the build finishes, two files 'scummvm.html' and 'scummvm.data' should have appeared. They are the two required files that need to be hosted by a web server for the game to run.

Last state: I managed to do a successful compile, but the webpage shows "stray argument": https://github.com/juj/emscripten-scummvm/issues/30
